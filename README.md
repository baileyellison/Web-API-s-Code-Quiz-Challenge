## Description
This project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and WebAPI's to produce a cohesive, simple and fun coding quiz game. The HTML and CSS give the application a structure. The real magic is in the JavaScript. The JavaScript files include a timer, functions which help the user navigate through the application with ease, and questions.

# Usage

The application uses prompted buttons to allow the user to navigate the questions. The user can start and exit the game after given rules. The user is allowed 60 seconds to answer 5 questions. If the user gets an answer wrong, the timer deducts 10 seconds from the clock. When entering the quiz, you can select an exit button which will bring the user back to the start page. There is a correct answer for each question which is highlighted if the person answers correctly. Once the user has completed all 5 questions, the user can save their score by inputting their intials. This will save to the local storage and allow the user to look back at their highscores.
